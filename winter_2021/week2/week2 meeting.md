## 1. Goal for the group

- To submit our paper to IROS on March
- To have an autonomous team to join the competition on March 

#### What is your personal goal? what is your main focus in your paper? 

- Zhaoliang: IROS paper publication
- Yifei: computer vision part + perception
- Parth: perception + micro-controller
- Ethan: perception + crazyfly (integrate the current hardware)
- Kyle: communication(fly control + raspi) + hardware (Pixracer)
- Own: hardware (PCB part) + connection + research

## 2. Logistics for FORAY group meeting

### For meetings

Monday meeting: (2 - 2:30 pm)

- Talk about goal
- Talk about what you want to do this week 
- Talk about how do you want to reach that goal

Wednesday meeting: (3 - 4 pm)

#### What other logistics do you think will help us to improve our efficiency and progress? 



## 3. What we need to do this week?

### Zhaoliang

- Place the order 
- Literature review on fin actuator
- Follow the plan and execute that plan with respect to research part

#### Please put your own work here for this week

Parth and Ethan: send out the quarterly plan

Own: Hardware research + talk to his friend about PCB design

Kyle: place the items order + research on Pixracer control

Yifei: Work with Parth and get one detection algorithm up and running 

## 4. Technical part

- What is the necessary parameters for fin actuator or Swing control surface ? 

- How do we verify the propulsion force using what kind of experiments ? 

#### what other technical issues that you have faced in this project this week? Please put it here so that we could discuss. 

No technical issue that we need to solve for this week. 

## 5. Key takeaway

- Send out the calendar about group meetings
- Walk Kyle through the purchasing process at 8:30 1/14/2020
- Talk to Yifei about my previous color segmentation program on Friday or Weekend
- Communicate with Luca(My former lab mate) and ask him about aerodynamic part and fin control part
- Try to make contact with Joseph (CMU phd student) and discuss about the current progress (try both Linkedin and Facebook)
