# Week6_zhaoliang

## Goal:

- Have the ability to know the relationship between diameter and different shape
- Have the ability to test weight distribution
- Have the ability to test different thrust distribution

## Deliverables:

- A report to tell the relationship between diameter and different shape
- An experimental analysis about weight distribution
- An experimental analysis about different thrust distribution

## Tasks:

- Get the crazyflie blimp setup up and running
- Get the GMU chip work
- Place the order of different material that we want to test
- Measure different diameters of balloon envelop and diameters of different inflated balloon
- Use Vicon system to measure the different weight distribution
