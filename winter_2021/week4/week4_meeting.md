- Talk about what you want to do this week 
- Talk about how do you want to reach that goal
- Discuss about who is willing to present literature on Friday

Some questions that I can think of:

Localization:

- How to set up a localization system in an open space?
  - portable
  - easy to install
  - can give the spacial info (xyz)
  - global system 

Crazyflie:

- How to program Crazyflie to do what we want?

Perception: 

- How's the detection algorithm and ML algorithm performance? 

Ethan:

- Finish the auto-control

- Get the AI deck working -camera module
- Program the firmware on Crazyflie 

Parth:

- ESP-cam with ML algorithm is now working 
- Localization pipeline, localize the position using camera

Yifei:

- Color segmentation is finish and uploaded 
- Try more complicated pictures 

Kyle:

- miniPix is now working, attitude and altitude is great
- PWM output - motor driver - DC motor 
- Get ROV setup up and running

- Work on the Ai-deck

## Friday meeting:

Meeting with GMU team: 

- Indoor localization? what method? visual onboard or visual based tracking system? 
  - camera multiple 
  - wifi strength: angle range

- Control board schematic 
- capture mechanism: carbon fabric

how to easily setup a indoor tracking system?

how to make the blimp red or blue?

For next week

Ethan: 

turn crazyflie into   

Yifei: 

Try real picture 

Kyle:

not yet decided
