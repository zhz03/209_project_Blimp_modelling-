## Goals:

- To have the ability to verify how can weight distribution impact the performance
- To figure out the relationship between different high-level parameters and low-level parameters
- To have the ability to verify the relationship between thrust and torque

## Deliverables:

- A report that describe the relationship between thrust and torque
- A blog post that describe the relationship between different high-level parameters and low-level parameters
- A pre-lab to tell how to verify the impact of weight distribution impact on performance

## Tasks:

- Plot the CAD schematic and use laser cutter to build the torque verification system

- Setup the force and torque experiment and execute it

- Write down the document about the relationship between different high-level parameters and low-level parameters

- Get the opti-track system up and running, we may need it in the weight distribution experiment
