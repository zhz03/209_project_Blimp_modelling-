# Week3 - Zhaoliang

## Goals:

- To have the ability to identify what results are needed in the paper
- To have the ability to verify propulsion force module
- To have the ability to identify all the necessary parameters for fin actuator

## Deliverables:

- Paper outline (results part especially)
- Literature review about fin and motor propeller
- A experiment pre-lab that clearly show how to easily verify the propulsion force
- An experiment platform set-up and ready for testing propulsion of all sorts of motors and propellers
- An simple experiment platform that could verify the fin actuator
- A experiment report 

## Tasks:

- Finish writing the results part of paper outline

- Write down the bibTex file about the paper of fin and motor propeller model 

- Document the what we got so far about the fin and motor propeller, pick out the most important takeaway from those paper 

- Write out the pre-lab of propulsion testing system

- Purchase what we need to build the propulsion testing system

- Test different motor propeller combination

- Test different shape of fin and servo motor(current) combination
