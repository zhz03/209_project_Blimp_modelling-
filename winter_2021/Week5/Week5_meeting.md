## Monday meeting

- Talk about ideas from other team
- Revisit rules

- Talk about goal
- Talk about what you want to do this week 
- Talk about how do you want to reach that goal 

## Summary about ideas from GMU team

As for control ships and localization:

- They are designing their own PCB board, this new design could incorporate multiple cameras, which is the main way for their blimps to detect things
- They are trying to use the signal strength to detect the relative distance between blimps
- Their blimps is trying to do all the computation on board

As for design of blimp:

- They are designing their own customized blimp since the fish balloon is not big enough to hold everything

As for the capture mechanism:

- They are using carbon fiber material to do it

## Goal and plan for each team member

Parth:

- Using camera to do localization indoor

- On board processing

Kyle:

- Sort of clean up the code (parameters space / different configuration)

- Make the chip up and running (Video from GMU) reprogram

Yifei:

- fit the algorithm to detect the real pictures

- Give eps-cam

Ethan: 

- Make the AI deck running
- Setup crazyfile

## Wednesday meeting

- Talk about your progress
- Talk about any difficulties, bring up the most difficult part and discuss about it
- Talk about how do we need help from others

## Friday meeting
