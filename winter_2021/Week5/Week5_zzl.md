# Week 5

## Goal:

- Have the ability to verify the impact of weight distribution on performance
- Have fully explore the design space of thrust
- Have the ability to know the relationship between different shape and other design parameters
- To know what should a capture mechanism look like and how to build it 

## Deliverables:

- Experiment report of verifying the impact of weight distribution on performance
- A design blueprint of the capture mechanism
- Experiment report about the detailed mapping between voltage and thrust and torque

## Tasks:

- Conduct the experiment of relationship between weight distribution and its low-level parameters:

- Conduct the experiment of testing relationship between thrust and torque, between thrust and voltage.

- Draw a blueprint of the capture mechanism

- Get familiar with the carzyflie and turn that into airship configuration
